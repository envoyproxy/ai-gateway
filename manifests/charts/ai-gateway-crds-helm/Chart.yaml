description: The Helm chart for Envoy AI Gateway CRD
type: application

# Note: in general version means the version of the chart, not the version of the application.
# version must be a semver version number like 0.0.1-rc1, 1.0.0, etc., vs appVersion can be anything.
#
# Since we release both the chart and the application together from the same repo, we don't need to differentiate
# between the two versions and use the release tag for both. However, on main branch, we use "latest" as the appVersion
# to follow the convention of container images vs v0.0.0-latest for the chart version.
version: v0.0.0-latest
appVersion: "latest"
