          LLMRoute combines multiple LLMBackends and attaching them to Gateway(s) resources.

          This serves as a way to define a "unified" LLM API for a Gateway which allows downstream
          clients to use a single schema API to interact with multiple LLM backends.

                    LocalPolicyTargetReferenceWithSectionName identifies an API object to apply a
                    direct policy to. This should be used as part of Policy resources that can
                    target single resources. For more information on how this policy attachment
                    mode works, and a sample Policy resource, refer to the policy attachment
                    documentation for Gateway API.

                    Note: This should only be used for direct policy attachment when references
                    to SectionName are actually needed. In all other cases,
                    LocalPolicyTargetReference should be used.

                        the Policy must fail to attach, and the policy implementation should record
                        a `ResolvedRefs` or similar Condition in the Policy's status.
