# Global configuration for the endpoints supported by the AI Gateway.
#
# By default, the AI Gateway will assume that the downstream client's OpenAI SDK will talk to the Gateway using the base_url
# set to "http://<gateway-hostname>/v1" which has the default "/v1" prefix in the base_url.
#
# By using this configuration, you can change the prefix for the OpenAI endpoints as well as the future non-OpenAI endpoints.
# For example, when you can configure the rootPrefix to "/ai" and the openAIPrefix to "/openai/v1" which will result in the
# OpenAI endpoints being served at "http://<gateway-hostname>/ai/openai/v1". This *will* become useful when you add support for
# other input schemas like Anthropic, Google Gemini, etc. and you want to serve them under a different prefix to avoid conflicts.
# Follow the issues https://github.com/envoyproxy/ai-gateway/issues/847 as well as https://github.com/envoyproxy/ai-gateway/issues/948 for detail.

  # The prefix for the OpenAI endpoints. Defaulting to "/v1". This comes **after** the rootPrefix. E.g. if the rootPrefix is "/ai" and the openAIPrefix is "/v1",
