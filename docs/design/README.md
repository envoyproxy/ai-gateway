# Design Documentation

This directory contains detailed design documents for various components of the AI Gateway. These documents explain the architecture, design decisions, and implementation details of key features.

## Documents

- [Credential Rotation](./credential-rotation.md) - Design of the AWS credential rotation system, including the TokenManager, rotators, and Kubernetes integration.

## Purpose

The design documents serve several purposes:

1. **Architecture Documentation**
   - Explain the high-level architecture of components
   - Document interactions between different parts of the system
   - Provide context for implementation decisions

2. **Developer Reference**
   - Help new contributors understand the system
   - Document design patterns and best practices
   - Explain complex interactions and flows

3. **Design History**
   - Record important design decisions
   - Document trade-offs and alternatives considered
   - Track evolution of the system

## Contributing

When adding new features or making significant changes:

1. Create or update design documents before implementation
2. Include sequence diagrams for complex interactions
3. Document security considerations and testing strategies
4. Update existing documents when designs change

## Format

Design documents should include:

- Overview of the feature/component
- Architecture and component diagrams
- Implementation details
- Security considerations
- Testing strategy
- Future enhancements
