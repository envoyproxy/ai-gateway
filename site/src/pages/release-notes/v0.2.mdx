## üìñ Upgrade Guidance

For users upgrading from v0.1.x to v0.2.0:

1. **Review usage of any deprecated API fields** (particularly `AIServiceBackend.Timeouts`).
1. **Update deployment configurations** if using custom replica configurations - the `replicas` field in `AIGatewayFilterConfigExternalProcessor` is now deprecated due to the new sidecar architecture.
1. **Remove routing to Kubernetes services** - currently, Envoy AI Gateway does not support routing to Kubernetes services. This is a known limitation and will be addressed in a future release.
