## üìñ Upgrade Guidance

For users upgrading from v0.2.x to v0.3.0:

1. **Upgrade Envoy Gateway to v1.5.0** - Ensure you are using Envoy Gateway v1.5.0 or later, as this is required for compatibility with the new AI Gateway features.
1. **Update Envoy Gateway config** - Update your Envoy Gateway configuration to include the new settings as below. The full manifest is available in the manifests/envoy-gateway-config/config.yaml file as per the getting started guide.

1. **Migrate backendSecurityPolicy references** - Update from the deprecated `AIServiceBackend.backendSecurityPolicyRef` pattern to the new `BackendSecurityPolicy.targetRefs` approach  after the upgrade to v0.3.0.
1. **Remove AIGatewayRoute.schema** - remove the `schema` field from `AIGatewayRoute` resources after the upgrade to v0.3.0, as it is no longer used.
