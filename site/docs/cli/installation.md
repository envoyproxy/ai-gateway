To install the `aigw` CLI, run the following command (This may take a while):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/envoyproxy/ai-gateway.git
cd ai-gateway
go install ./cmd/aigw
```

:::tip
`git clone` step is a temporary workaround for the issue with `go install`. See the issue [#1064](https://github.com/envoyproxy/ai-gateway/issues/1064) for details.

`go install` command installs a binary in the `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` directory.
Make sure that the `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` directory is in your `PATH` environment variable.

For example, you can add the following line to your shell profile (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):
```sh
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```
:::

Now, you can check if the installation was successful by running the following command:

```sh
aigw --help
```

This will display the help message for the `aigw` CLI like this:

```
