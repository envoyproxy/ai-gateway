sidebar_position: 8
---

Envoy AI Gateway provides first-class support for [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP), enabling AI agents to securely connect to external tools and data sources.

This guide provides an overview of the MCP Gateway capabilities and how to configure routing to MCP servers using the `MCPRoute` API.

## Overview

Envoy AI Gateway's MCP support allows you to:

- **Aggregate multiple MCP servers** into a single unified endpoint
- **Apply security policies** including OAuth authentication and upstream API key injection
- **Filter tools** to control which capabilities are exposed to clients
- **Leverage Envoy's networking** for load balancing, rate limiting, circuit breaking, and observability

The MCP Gateway acts as a transparent proxy between MCP clients (AI agents like Claude, Goose, etc.) and backend MCP servers, providing the same production-grade features available for LLM traffic.

## Architecture

The MCP Gateway is implemented as a lightweight proxy component within the Envoy AI Gateway sidecar, leveraging Envoy's battle-tested networking stack for all connection handling.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as MCP Client<br/>(AI Agent)
    participant Gateway as Envoy AI Gateway
    participant MCP1 as MCP Server 1
    participant MCP2 as MCP Server 2

    Client->>Gateway: Initialize session
    Gateway->>MCP1: Initialize
    Gateway->>MCP2: Initialize
    MCP1-->>Gateway: Session ID 1
    MCP2-->>Gateway: Session ID 2
    Gateway-->>Client: Unified Session ID

    Client->>Gateway: List tools
    Gateway->>MCP1: List tools
    Gateway->>MCP2: List tools
    MCP1-->>Gateway: Tools A, B
    MCP2-->>Gateway: Tools X, Y
    Gateway-->>Client: Filtered & merged tools

    Client->>Gateway: Call tool (server1__toolA)
    Gateway->>MCP1: Call toolA
    MCP1-->>Gateway: Result
    Gateway-->>Client: Result
```

**Key architectural aspects:**

- **Session Management**: The gateway creates unified sessions by encoding multiple backend session IDs, handling reconnection with `Last-Event-ID` support for SSE streams.
- **Notification Handling**: Long-lived SSE streams from multiple MCP servers are merged into a single stream for clients, with proper event ID reconstruction.
- **Request Routing**: Tool names are automatically prefixed with the backend name (e.g., `github__get_issue`) to route calls to the correct upstream server.

For detailed architecture and design decisions, see the [MCP Gateway proposal](https://github.com/envoyproxy/ai-gateway/tree/main/docs/proposals/006-mcp-gateway).

## Trying it out

Before you begin, you'll need to complete the basic setup from the [Basic Usage](/docs/getting-started/basic-usage) guide, which includes installing Envoy Gateway and AI Gateway.

### Basic MCPRoute Configuration

The following example demonstrates a basic `MCPRoute` that proxies the GitHub MCP server:

```yaml
apiVersion: aigateway.envoyproxy.io/v1alpha1
kind: MCPRoute
metadata:
  name: mcp-route
  namespace: default
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: aigw-run
      kind: Gateway
      group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
  path: "/mcp" # Clients connect to http://gateway-address/mcp
  backendRefs:
    - name: github
      kind: Backend
      group: gateway.envoyproxy.io
      path: "/mcp/x/issues/readonly"
      securityPolicy:
        apiKey:
          secretRef:
            name: github-token
---
apiVersion: gateway.envoyproxy.io/v1alpha1
kind: Backend
metadata:
  name: github
  namespace: default
spec:
  endpoints:
    - fqdn:
        hostname: api.githubcopilot.com
        port: 443
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: github-token
  namespace: default
type: Opaque
stringData:
  apiKey: ghp_your_token_here
```

Apply this configuration:

```shell
kubectl apply -f mcp-route.yaml
```

Now clients can connect to `http://<gateway-address>/mcp` and access GitHub tools.

### Tool Filtering

Control which tools are exposed using the `toolSelector` field. You can use exact matches or regular expressions:

```yaml
apiVersion: aigateway.envoyproxy.io/v1alpha1
kind: MCPRoute
metadata:
  name: mcp-route
  namespace: default
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: aigw-run
      kind: Gateway
      group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
  backendRefs:
    # GitHub: only expose issue-related tools
    - name: github
      kind: Backend
      group: gateway.envoyproxy.io
      path: "/mcp/x/issues/readonly"
      toolSelector:
        includeRegex:
          - .*_issues?.* # Matches get_issue, list_issues, etc.
      securityPolicy:
        apiKey:
          secretRef:
            name: github-token

    # Context7: expose specific tools by exact name
    - name: context7
      kind: Backend
      group: gateway.envoyproxy.io
      path: "/mcp"
      toolSelector:
        include:
          - resolve-library-id
          - get-library-docs
```

:::note
The `toolSelector` field requires exactly one of `include` or `includeRegex` to be specified. If not specified, all tools from the MCP server are exposed.
:::

### Server Multiplexing

The gateway automatically aggregates tools from multiple MCP servers into a single unified interface:

```yaml
apiVersion: aigateway.envoyproxy.io/v1alpha1
kind: MCPRoute
metadata:
  name: mcp-unified
  namespace: default
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: aigw-run
      kind: Gateway
      group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
  path: "/mcp"
  backendRefs:
    - name: github
      kind: Backend
      group: gateway.envoyproxy.io
      path: "/mcp/x/issues/readonly"
      securityPolicy:
        apiKey:
          secretRef:
            name: github-token
    - name: context7
      kind: Backend
      group: gateway.envoyproxy.io
      path: "/mcp"
```

Clients will see all tools with prefixed names:

- `github__get_issue`
- `github__list_issues`
- `context7__resolve-library-id`
- `context7__get-library-docs`

### OAuth Authentication

Protect your MCP Gateway with OAuth authentication following the [MCP Authorization specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/authorization):

```yaml
apiVersion: aigateway.envoyproxy.io/v1alpha1
kind: MCPRoute
metadata:
  name: mcp-route
  namespace: default
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: aigw-run
      kind: Gateway
      group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
  backendRefs:
    - name: github
      kind: Backend
      group: gateway.envoyproxy.io
      path: "/mcp/readonly"
  securityPolicy:
    oauth:
      issuer: "https://keycloak.example.com/realms/master"
      audiences:
        - "https://api.example.com/mcp"
      protectedResourceMetadata:
        resource: "https://api.example.com/mcp"
        scopesSupported:
          - "profile"
          - "email"
```

The OAuth flow follows the MCP specification's authorization code flow with PKCE:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as MCP Client
    participant G as MCP Gateway
    participant A as Authorization Server

    C->>G: MCP request without token
    G->>C: HTTP 401 with WWW-Authenticate header

    C->>G: Request Protected Resource Metadata
    G->>C: Return OAuth metadata

    C->>A: GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server
    A->>C: Authorization server metadata

    Note over C: Generate PKCE parameters
    C->>A: Authorization request + PKCE
    Note over A: User authorizes
    A->>C: Authorization code

    C->>A: Token request + code_verifier
    A->>C: Access token

    C->>G: MCP request with access token
    G->>G: Verify token (JWKS)
    Note over G: Token validated
    G->>C: MCP response
```
