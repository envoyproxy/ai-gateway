title: Access Logs With AI/LLM Metadata
sidebar_position: 8

It is possible to configure Envoy Access Logs to include metadata generated by the AI Gateway such as
the selected model and token consumption. This guide walks through the steps to configure the AI Gateway
Routes to generate LLM token consumption metadata and to configure the Envoy Access Logs to include the AI/LLM details.

## Overview

Envoy AI Gateway populates information in the filter dynamic metadata under the `io.envoy.ai_gateway` namespace.
This metadata includes information about the selected model, prompt and completion token usage, and other
details about the LLM request, and can be extracted and included in the Envoy Access Logs.

### AIGatewayRoute configuration

The contents of the dynamic metadata are configured in the `AIGatewayRoute` resource under the `llmRequestCosts`
field. The `llmRequestCosts` field configures a list of metadata keys to populate in the Envoy filter metadata, to
be later accessed in the access logs. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: ai-gateway.envoyproxy.io/v1alpha1
kind: AIGatewayRoute
metadata:
  name: ai-gateway-route
spec:
  (...)
  llmRequestCosts:
    - metadataKey: llm_input_token
      type: InputToken
    - metadataKey: llm_output_token
      type: OutputToken
    - metadataKey: llm_total_token
      type: TotalToken
  rules:
    (...)
```

### EnvoyProxy Configuration

Once the `AIGatewayRoute` is configured to populate the dynamic metadata, the Envoy Access Logs can be configured
to include the metadata in the log entries. This can be done by configuring the access logs in the `EnvoyProxy`
resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.envoyproxy.io/v1alpha1
kind: EnvoyProxy
metadata:
  name: ai-access-logs
  namespace: default
spec:
  telemetry:
    accessLog:
      settings:
        - sinks:
            - type: File
              file:
                path: /dev/stdout
          format:
            type: JSON
            json:
              # AI specific fields. The properties in the dynamic metadata expressions must match the ones
              # defined in the AIGatewayRoute llmRequestCosts field.
              genai_model_name: "%REQ(X-AI-EG-MODEL)%"
              genai_model_name_override: "%DYNAMIC_METADATA(io.envoy.ai_gateway:model_name_override)%"
              genai_backend_name: "%DYNAMIC_METADATA(io.envoy.ai_gateway:backend_name)%"
              genai_tokens_total: "%DYNAMIC_METADATA(io.envoy.ai_gateway:llm_total_token)%"
              genai_tokens_input: "%DYNAMIC_METADATA(io.envoy.ai_gateway:llm_input_token)%"
              genai_tokens_output: "%DYNAMIC_METADATA(io.envoy.ai_gateway:llm_output_token)%"
              # Default fields
              start_time: "%START_TIME%"
              method: "%REQ(:METHOD)%"
              x-envoy-origin-path: "%REQ(X-ENVOY-ORIGINAL-PATH?:PATH)%"
              protocol: "%PROTOCOL%"
              response_code: "%RESPONSE_CODE%"
              response_flags: "%RESPONSE_FLAGS%"
              response_code_details: "%RESPONSE_CODE_DETAILS%"
              connection_termination_details: "%CONNECTION_TERMINATION_DETAILS%"
              upstream_transport_failure_reason: "%UPSTREAM_TRANSPORT_FAILURE_REASON%"
              bytes_received: "%BYTES_RECEIVED%"
              bytes_sent: "%BYTES_SENT%"
              duration: "%DURATION%"
              x-envoy-upstream-service-time: "%RESP(X-ENVOY-UPSTREAM-SERVICE-TIME)%"
              x-forwarded-for: "%REQ(X-FORWARDED-FOR)%"
              user-agent: "%REQ(USER-AGENT)%"
              x-request-id: "%REQ(X-REQUEST-ID)%"
              ":authority": "%REQ(:AUTHORITY)%"
              upstream_host: "%UPSTREAM_HOST%"
              upstream_cluster: "%UPSTREAM_CLUSTER%"
              upstream_local_address: "%UPSTREAM_LOCAL_ADDRESS%"
              downstream_local_address: "%DOWNSTREAM_LOCAL_ADDRESS%"
              downstream_remote_address: "%DOWNSTREAM_REMOTE_ADDRESS%"
              requested_server_name: "%REQUESTED_SERVER_NAME%"
              route_name: "%ROUTE_NAME%"
```

In this example we're adding the `genai_*` properties with the values extracted from the filter metadata populated
by the AI Gateway. The `EnvoyProxy` resource must be attached to the `Gateway` object or to the `GatewayClass`. For
example:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: envoy-ai-gateway-basic
  namespace: default
spec:
  gatewayClassName: envoy-ai-gateway-basic
  listeners:
    - name: http
      protocol: HTTP
      port: 80
  infrastructure:
    parametersRef:
      group: gateway.envoyproxy.io
      kind: EnvoyProxy
      name: ai-access-logs
```

With this configuration, the access log entries will include the AI Gateway metadata and look like this:

```json
{
  ":authority": "api.router.tetrate.ai",
  "bytes_received": 105,
  "bytes_sent": 432,
  "connection_termination_details": null,
  "downstream_local_address": "127.0.0.1:1975",
  "downstream_remote_address": "127.0.0.1:64484",
  "duration": 1526,
  "genai_backend_name": "default/tars/route/aigw-run/rule/0/ref/0",
  "genai_model_name": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "genai_model_name_override": null,
  "genai_tokens_input": 15,
  "genai_tokens_output": 7,
  "genai_tokens_total": 22,
  "method": "POST",
  "protocol": "HTTP/1.1",
  "requested_server_name": null,
  "response_code": 200,
  "response_code_details": "via_upstream",
  "response_flags": "-",
  "route_name": "httproute/default/aigw-run/rule/0/match/0/*",
  "start_time": "2025-08-30T16:51:37.894Z",
  "upstream_cluster": "httproute/default/aigw-run/rule/0",
  "upstream_host": "34.128.142.77:443",
  "upstream_local_address": "192.168.1.38:64485",
  "upstream_transport_failure_reason": null,
  "user-agent": "curl/8.7.1",
  "x-envoy-origin-path": "/v1/chat/completions",
  "x-envoy-upstream-service-time": "451",
  "x-forwarded-for": "192.168.1.38",
  "x-request-id": "83b63da3-45a9-4196-98b8-1a7f697d6d8d"
}
```

## Trying it out

You can deploy the example to quickly try the access log configuration against a local backend:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/envoyproxy/ai-gateway/main/examples/access-log/basic.yaml
```

Once everything is applied you can send requests to the gateway and see the access logs in the gateway pod logs.
