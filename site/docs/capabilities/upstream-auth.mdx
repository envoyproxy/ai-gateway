# Upstream Authentication

## Overview

Upstream Authentication secures the connectivity between the Gateway and the LLM Providers. This layer ensures secure communication and proper access control when the Gateway interacts with various AI service providers like AWS Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, and other platforms. Where the providers support it, the Envoy AI Gateway control plane supports dynamic automatic credential rotation to ensure short-lived access tokens and credentials are used for increased security.

## Why Upstream Authentication Matters

Upstream Authentication is essential for several reasons:

1. **Security Layer**: It provides a secure authentication mechanism between the Gateway and upstream providers, preventing credentials sprawl across teams and organizations.

1. **Credential Management**: It allows AI platform teams to handle the secure storage and management of credentials and use them in one place. This makes the revocation and rotation of credentials easier.

1. **Compliance**: It helps organizations meet security and compliance requirements by maintaining proper authentication protocols and enforcing controlled usage of AI resources.

## Enterprise Security Architecture

In enterprise environments, security is implemented in multiple layers:

1. **Client to Gateway Authentication**
   - Clients must authenticate to the Gateway using appropriate methods (API keys, OAuth, etc.) aligned with the organization's security standards
   - This ensures only authorized clients can access the Gateway's services, and the Gateway enforces the access to the upstream providers and models

1. **Gateway to Upstream Authentication**
   - The Gateway must authenticate to upstream providers
   - This layer is managed by Upstream Authentication
   - Ensures secure communication between the Gateway and AI service providers

## Dynamic Credential Management

The Gateway integrates with each provider's identity system to ensure secure, short-lived authentication:

- **AWS Bedrock**: Uses OIDC integration with AWS STS to generate temporary credentials for each request
- **Azure OpenAI**: Leverages Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) to provide short-lived access tokens

In both cases, the Gateway automatically manages these credentials, ensuring that each request to upstream providers is authenticated with fresh, short-lived credentials. This approach significantly reduces the risk of credential exposure and aligns with enterprise security best practices.

## Conclusion

Upstream Authentication is a key component of the Envoy AI Gateway's security architecture. It ensures secure communication between the Gateway and upstream AI service providers while supporting modern authentication methods and enterprise security requirements. Leverage Envoy AI Gateway's Upstream Authentication to maintain a secure and compliant AI infrastructure in your enterprise environments.
